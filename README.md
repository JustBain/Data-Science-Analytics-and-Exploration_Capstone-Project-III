# Data-Science-Analytics-and-Exploration_Capstone-Project-III

## Purpose
The Capstone Project III is conducted as an EDA on data selected from a source of my choosing. For this EDA, a data set containing historic dam level info for the period from November 2015 to March 2016. The overall purpose is to review and provide clarity on the information contained within the data set and explore any trends or underlying information that we can extract from the state of the dams during the period in question. 

## Data Set
The dam levels data set contains records of 211 water bodies across South Africa. The set includes geographic coordinates, dam capacities, catchment areas and additional water management descriptors. Furthermore, there is a bank of continuous type data columns depicting the dam levels in both volumetric parameters and as a percentage of actual design capacity. 

The set did however contain a large amount of columns with a high degree of missingness. The columns and specific dam records showing a large portion of missing values were dropped and therefore not included in the analysis. 

## Data Analysis
**Data Cleaning and Missing Data**
A series of scatter and line plots are generated to explore the overall data distribution. Additionally to highlight any trends trends or relationships between the columns as well as clearly showing any outliers present within the set. Some outliers were further assessed and found to be true, such as the volume of Gariep Dam which is the country's largest body of water. Finally, the formatting was formalised and data types set correctly to ease the modelling process.
